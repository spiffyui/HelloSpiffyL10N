Hello Spiffy Localization is built with [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) using [Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/).  Once you've installed Ant go to your project's root directory and run this command:

        <ANT HOME>/ant run
        
This will download Apache Ivy and the other the required libraries, build your project, and run it with an embedded Jetty web server.  It will then provide instructions for accessing the running application once the build is completed.
